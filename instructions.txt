Hello, Welcome to my solution to the HomeX Problem!

Here are a couple of instructions to be able to run this and how to see the output :).

Firstly, ensure your environment is Python3 and you have pip install working.

Secondly, install all of the requirements in this project in the requirements.txt, a simple way to do this is the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Secondly, ensure that you have the MySQL 5.7 Database up and running! Then you can modify the config.yaml to ensure that
the proper connection details are there, such as password. (I know I don't handle password encryption in this, but I figured
for a coding challenge that is not required)

Now we can actual run the API!

python app.py

This will kick off the Python application which is a Flask API. I have added two routes to this API and will explain
both below.

By default the API will be hosted on localhost:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

so I have two routes
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This route will attempt to return the data, but I was having some problem with depth first vs breadth first giving me
some problems with the hierarchy of data. But fear not! The proper solution will still be printed onto the console every
time you hit the API in proper hierarchical format.

Second route is
http://127.0.0.1:5000/json

This route will return the data in JSON format as a json dump for queryable data. I believe this was a stretch-goal as well
as hosting an API, but I figured it would be a good demonstration of my ability.

Thanks for the challenge, it was a lot of fun and refresher on Flask as well as templating. Sorry I was not able to get the
nodes and collapsible nodes, but I'm sure with a bit more time and one or two more PRs I would have it.

Thank you,
Pablo

p.s I have attached some screenshots in this zip which have screenshots of the utility, and they will also be hosted on my git
